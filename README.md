# Corona Virus Analysis

Our analysis provides a comprehensive timeline, pinpointing the start date, end date, and duration in months of the dataset. By understanding the temporal dimension of the pandemic, stakeholders gain invaluable context for strategic decision-making and resource allocation.

Navigate the labyrinth of COVID-19 statistics with precision, as we dissect total confirmed, recovered, and deaths cases across nations and regions. Through SQL queries, unravel the highest and lowest recorded figures, shedding light on the epicenters of the crisis and the outliers defying the odds.

Zoom in on resilience and recovery, as we spotlight countries with the highest recovered cases. Identify success stories and best practices, offering inspiration and guidance for nations grappling with the aftermath of the pandemic.

Simultaneously, we shine a light on countries with the lowest death tolls, celebrating triumphs in public health response and mitigation strategies. By benchmarking against these exemplars, stakeholders gain actionable insights into effective crisis management and containment efforts.

In a world reshaped by COVID-19, our SQL dataset analysis serves as a beacon of clarity amidst uncertainty, empowering decision-makers with the knowledge to navigate the crisis and emerge stronger on the other side.

# NREGA (National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) Analysis in Power BI

![alt text](https://github.com/Aayush-Basnet/Mentorness-Internship/blob/83e663699a957250fb3d8f0d7c275f33d324326f/Task%203/NREGA%20image.jpeg)

NREGA is a transformative government scheme aimed at providing rural households with guaranteed wage employment opportunities.
 ### Problem Statement:
 
NREGA is a vital initiative to alleviate rural unemployment and poverty. This project seeks to address several key questions and challenges associated with NREGA:
1. How effective is NREGA in providing employment opportunities to rural households?
2. Are there regional disparities in the implementation and outcomes of the scheme?
3. What is the utilization of the allocated budget, and how does it correlate with employment generation?
4. What are the key factors contributing to the completion of NREGA works, and are there any roadblocks to its success?
5. Can data-driven insights guide policymakers and administrators in optimizing the scheme's impact?


The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from official government records and contains information related to NREGA implementation across various states and districts in India. It comprises 28 columns, encompassing data on job cards, worker details, budget allocation, work completion statistics, expenditure, and more. This dataset offers a comprehensive view of the progress and challenges faced by the NREGA program. Through the application of data analytics techniques, we aim to gain valuable insights into the implementation and impact of NREGA across different states and districts in India.
